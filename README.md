# Elytra Booster Mod

This mod adds an upgrade to Immersive Aircraft to try to make the airplanes viable in the end game of a Minecraft playtrough!
The mod can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/elytra-booster-mod).
Also, special thanks to Conczin for pointing out my blindness to buttons with wiki written on it.

# TODO (not all of these are guaranteed)

Custom plane(s)
